A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to analog or digital code. Rotary encoders are usually placed at the side which is perpendicular to the shaft. They act as sensors for detecting angle, speed, length, position, and acceleration in automation field.
